**Thirst** is a simple mod that adds a thirst mechanic to the game, but that fits well in modpacks (especially **aesthetics**-oriented ones) by adding diverse features and compatibility with a lot of often-used mods.

This is a fork of [Thirst-Mod](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod). Update features and fix bugs.
